Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have done almost everything. The whole code is written, just need to fix some of the math that is used.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not added the part where the user can see what the macros are.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

A big part of the project is giving individual users specific macros for what they consume. I am sort of understanding it, but I am having trouble with it. It is a part of the project that may not make it, but I am trying my best.
