# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Macr0s

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An app that will help users count carlories to help acheive an ideal weight.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The app Macr0s will take the information of a client (height, weight, sex) and then ask for an ideal weight that they would like to achieve. The app will then give the user an amount of calories they should consume, and the date they will acheive the weight if they stay consistent. The app should tell the user about how many macros they should consumer as well. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

none 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be that the app tells the user accurate information
A good outcome would be that the app tells the user an accurate amount of macros.
A good outcome would be the app can use both male and female imputs.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can get everything done, but the hardest part will be giving a date to the user that will tell them the day they should achieve their goal.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be that the app can do everything it is supposed to, from getting the information to using that information to help the user with their goal. It will give accurate information for the user.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step is to look at apps that already do this sort of stuff. The skills I will need is alot of math mainly algebra. The topics I will need to research are how many days it take to lose a pound, basically I need to understand intake vs outtake when looking at losing weight. This will be challenging because everyone is different, and giving them an accurate date when they will acheive their goal is hard. The macros they should consume on a day to day basis will also be difficult as well because theres millions of types of food.
